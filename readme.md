## Spraoi Interview Coding Challenge

The file `get_type.py` is my solution to the challenge available here: https://gist.github.com/scuddalo/3ef7a5d4a1d8aaeb63ba15c91464242a.  

My solution was written in Python 3.7.4.  No libraries need to be imported into the environment.


`test_get_type.py` verifies that my solution passes the provided tests.
